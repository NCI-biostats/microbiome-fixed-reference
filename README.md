# Microbiome analysis using a standard reference
For a nicer version of this tutorial go to [http://rpubs.com/NCI-biostats/microbiome-fixed-reference](http://rpubs.com/NCI-biostats/microbiome-fixed-reference).

In that tutorial we describe and show examples of R code implementing methods to use standard microbiome reference groups to simplify beta-diversity analyses and faclitate independent validation as described in **Using standard microbiome reference groups to simplify beta-diversity analyses and facilitate independent validation** by Marlena Maziarz, Ruth M. Pfeiffer, Yunhu Wan and Mitchell H. Gail. The code, test files, HMP reference sets and any other necessary files are on [https://github.com/NCI-biostats/microbiome-fixed-reference](https://github.com/NCI-biostats/microbiome-fixed-reference).

Specifically, the tutorial describes the use of two functions: **HMPdistance** and **GHotelling**. HMPdistance calculates distance to the HMP stool and nasal reference sets, GHotelling is a generalized Hotelling test, which accounts for correlation between samples from the same individual.
